7 size array
	if community has straight
		nothing (because it's a 0.39 percent chance that it would happen)

	if community has 4 consecutive
		pass first card to check for consecutive( backward)
		pass second card to check for consecutive( backward)
		if straight is true record last card used (highest value)
	if community has 3 consecutive
		pass both in and check for consecutive ( backward)
		if straight is true record last card used (highest value)

Ex:
p1 5 11 wins at 34567
p2 5 9 wins 34567

2 3 4 (5) 6 7 (9)

2 3 4 5 6   8 9 






Flush:


determine suit of 2 player cards
	find if the suits match
		ADD 1 TO MATCH
			IF MATCH EQUALS 1
				then compare with community
				if communityMatch = 3 && match = 1 return flush
				else
				nothing		
else 
compare first card with community card until match suits
use that suit and make a counter, 4 match == true  
	if false
		sets match back to 0 to compare the next card with community cards
	
Ex:
H C  H H D H H

Straight flush

	if flush = true && straight == true
		then true
			send combination to royal flush
	else 
	nothing

royal flush
	highest is Ace and consecutive









*goal for Monday:

+change player hand array from 5 to 2

+delete check combinations

+revise bool functions


+ Pairs functions doesnt work properly since we're not checking all the community cards

+ set up the table
